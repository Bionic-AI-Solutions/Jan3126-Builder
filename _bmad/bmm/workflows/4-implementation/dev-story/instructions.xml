  <!-- PREREQUISITE WORKFLOWS
    This workflow expects the following workflows to have been completed BEFORE dev-story:
    
    1. groom-story (@bmad/bmm/workflows/groom-story)
       - Creates tasks in OpenProject
       - Creates MANDATORY test task (Task X.Y.T)
       - Breaks story into implementable tasks
       - SM verifies tasks are created
       
    2. epic-story-lifecycle (@bmad/bmm/workflows/epic-story-lifecycle)
       - Defines complete lifecycle rules
       - Enforces test task requirement
       - Helper functions: update_story_status_based_on_tasks()
       
    CRITICAL: Story CANNOT be closed without test task being completed.
    If tasks don't exist, this workflow will HALT and redirect to groom-story.

    Key RACI Notes:
    - PM creates development tasks during groom-story, SM ensures they exist
    - TEA creates test task (Task X.Y.T) during grooming, SM ensures it exists
    - Dev verifies tasks exist before starting implementation
    - Dev is Responsible and Accountable for story implementation
    - Dev uses update_task_status_and_parent() for status updates
    - Dev must follow red-green-refactor cycle
    - TEA is Consulted for testing patterns, Accountable for integration testing
    - Architect is Consulted for technical decisions
    - All code changes must satisfy acceptance criteria before completion
    
    CRITICAL: Story CANNOT be closed without test task (Task X.Y.T) completed.

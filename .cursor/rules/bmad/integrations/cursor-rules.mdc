# BMAD Integrations

<critical>LOAD and FOLLOW the complete integration rules from @_bmad/integrations/cursor-rules.mdc</critical>

This provides standard integration behaviors for all BMAD agents including:
- OpenProject for work management AND document storage
- Archon for EXTERNAL knowledge search ONLY
- Agent-specific integration responsibilities
- Standard workflow patterns

The full integration rules are maintained in `_bmad/integrations/cursor-rules.mdc` for IDE portability.

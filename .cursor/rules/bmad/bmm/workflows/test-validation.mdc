1. Always LOAD the FULL @_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/test-validation/workflow.yaml
2. READ its entire contents - this contains the complete test validation workflow
3. Follow the workflow instructions EXACTLY as written
4. The workflow handles task/story validation, bug creation, and closure quality gates
</steps>
